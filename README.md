DNA Recognition by Facial Resemblance
A Python-based system that quantifies visual facial resemblance between a baby and its parents using facial landmark analysis to suggest inherited features. This project serves as a proof-of-concept for exploring genetic traits through computer vision.

🌟 Features
Facial Landmark Detection: Accurately identifies 68 facial landmarks using the face_recognition library.

Geometric Feature Extraction: Calculates various facial measurements such as nose length, eye width, mouth width, inter-eye distance, and chin height.

Weighted Similarity Scoring: Computes a comprehensive resemblance score for the baby to both the mother and the father, based on a customizable set of weighted facial features.

Detailed CSV Report Generation: Stores all raw measurements, individual feature similarities, and overall weighted resemblance scores in a structured CSV file (analysis_results.csv).

Trend Analysis Visualization: Generates a line graph (overall_similarity_trend.png) to visualize how the baby's overall resemblance to each parent evolves over multiple analyses.

Feature-Specific Resemblance Breakdown: Provides a textual report detailing the baby's resemblance to each parent for individual facial features.

(Placeholder for future enhancement): Designed to support visual comparison images of cropped facial features (eyes, nose, mouth, chin) if the analysis module is extended to save these.

💡 How It Works
Image Input: The system takes photographs of the mother, father, and one or more baby photos as input.

Face Detection & Landmark Identification: For each image, it detects faces and maps 68 distinct facial landmarks (e.g., corners of eyes, points along the nose, outline of the mouth).

Feature Measurement: Based on these landmarks, various geometric measurements (distances, ratios) are calculated for specific facial features.

Normalization & Similarity: These measurements are normalized against predefined ranges to ensure consistency and then compared between the baby and each parent. A similarity percentage is derived for each feature.

Weighted Aggregation: Individual feature similarities are combined into an overall weighted resemblance score, giving more importance to certain features (e.g., nose, eyes) as defined by FEATURE_WEIGHTS.

Reporting & Visualization: The results are saved to a CSV file, and a report is generated, including a trend graph and a detailed breakdown of feature resemblances.

🚀 Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

pip (Python package installer)

git (for cloning the repository)

Installation
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/ChandanM123456/DNA-Recognition-by-Facial-Resemblance.git
cd DNA-Recognition-by-Facial-Resemblance
Create a virtual environment (recommended):

Bash

python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
Install the required Python packages:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Prepare Your Photos
Create the following directory structure inside your project folder if it doesn't already exist:

.
├── captured_faces/
│   ├── baby/
│   ├── father/
│   └── mother/
├── analysis_module.py
├── report.py
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md
Place one clear photo of the mother in captured_faces/mother/.

Example: captured_faces/mother/mother_20250728_200624.jpg

Place one clear photo of the father in captured_faces/father/.

Example: captured_faces/father/father_20250728_200721.jpg

Place one or more clear photos of the baby in captured_faces/baby/.

Example: captured_faces/baby/baby_20250728_200523.jpg

The system will analyze all photos found in the baby/ directory.

Important Photo Tips:

Use clear, well-lit photos.

Faces should be frontal and not obstructed.

Avoid extreme angles, strong shadows, or blurry images for best results.

For the initial run, using the example filenames shown in the console output might be helpful to mirror the provided log, though any .jpg, .jpeg, or .png files will work.

🏃 Running the Project
The project consists of two main scripts: analysis_module.py (to perform the facial analysis and save data) and report.py (to generate reports and visualizations from the saved data).

Run the Analysis Module:
This script will process the photos and save the resemblance data to analysis_results.csv.

Bash

python analysis_module.py
You will see debug output in the console indicating the processing of each baby photo and the weighted sum/total effective weight calculation.

Run the Report Generation Module:
This script reads the data from analysis_results.csv and generates a text-based report in the console, along with an image file (overall_similarity_trend.png) and (if feature image cropping is implemented) individual feature comparison images in the reports/ directory.

Bash

python report.py
The console will display the latest facial resemblance report, and image files will be saved in the reports/ directory.
